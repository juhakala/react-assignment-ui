# react-assignment-ui

```
Pre assignment for Reaktor with react and node.js proxy to avoid CORS issue with secure browsers

Running on Heroku:
https://react-assignment-ui.herokuapp.com/

- Saves category name to category-hook (default: 'gloves')
- when category is changed ( useEffect(() => {...}, [category]) ) 
    - fetches that category with axios.get(url/:category) and saves to items-hook array 
      or takes from memory and puts to front of items-hook array
    - saves unique manufacturer names to que-hook
      - ( useEffect(() => {...}, [que]) )
        - makes async request of whole que and saves satisfactory results to manus-hook,  
          bad responses will co back to que

Instructions:
Your client is a clothing brand that is looking for a simple web app to use in their warehouses.  
To do their work efficiently, the warehouse workers need a fast and simple listing page per 
product category, where they can check simple product and availability information from a single
UI. There are three product categories they are interested in for now: gloves, facemasks, and  
beanies. Therefore, you should implement three web pages corresponding to those categories that  
list all the products in a given category. One requirement is to be easily able to switch between  
product categories quickly. You are free to implement any UI you want, as long as it can display  
multiple products at once in a straightforward and explicit listing. At this point, it is not  
necessary to implement filtering or pagination functionality on the page.

The client does not have a ready-made API for this purpose. Instead, they have two different  
legacy APIs that combined can provide the needed information. The legacy APIs are on  
critical-maintenance-only mode, and thus further changes to them are not possible. The client  
knows the APIs are not excellent, but they are asking you to work around any issues in the APIs  
in your new application. The client has instructed you that both APIs have an internal cache of  
about 5 minutes.

API:
- GET /v2/products/:category – Return a listing of products in a given category.
- GET /v2/availability/:manufacturer – Return a list of availability info.
- The APIs are running at https://bad-api-assignment.reaktor.com/.

Your task is to implement a web application that fits the client brief and host the running  
solution somewhere where it can be accessed publicly (e.g. Heroku). Please include a link to  
the source code and the running application in your application.

Some pointers you might want to take into account:
- You can keep the UI side simpler than it would be in a real-life situation. You do not need to  
  implement filtering, search, or pagination.
- Be mindful of page loading speed and error handling in the application code itself, but using  
  free hosting options with long-ish startup times on the first load is fine.
- The API is supposed to resemble working with a real-life legacy API. It has a built-in intentional  
  failure case that you might run into while developing. To ease up reproducing the issue without  
  needing to wait for the next random request failure, we provide a request header: x-force-error-mode.  
  Set to allto force the failure to reproduce.
